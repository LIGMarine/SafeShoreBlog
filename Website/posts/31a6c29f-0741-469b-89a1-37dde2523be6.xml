  <content>SafeShore has partnered with a new Admitted MEL Market.  This means no more state surplus lines fees, taxes or required filings with the state for your Covered Employer.  This market is the American Alternative Insurance Company.  They have an AM Best rating of A+ (Superior).  This program can quote MEL premium as low as $3,000 for contractual only requirements or $5,000 for true exposure.  This MEL market is not just for Soft MEL but can also offer Intermediate and Hard MEL.</content>
